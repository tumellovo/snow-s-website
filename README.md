# Week 2 - Styling, Snowing & Superheroes

It's Week 2 of my 9-week web development journey, and this week was all about adding a little style to our websites.

## Part One: Revisiting Web ka S'now

We took our Week 1 project - `Web ka S'now` - and brought it back into the spotlight.

This time around:
- We added a `style.css` file
- Connected it using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css>` inside our HTML files
- Played around with colours, fonts, and simple CSS properties to get comfortable with styling

It was basically a remix of Week 1 with a new wardrobe. This is where CSS enteredthe chat.

Folder: `Web ka S'now`
Still the same structure - just with added style.

## Part Two: S'now's Website
A fresh build from the ground up using everything we've learned so far.

## What I Took Away

- How to actually use CSS, not just talk about it
- How to link external stylesheets properly
- That even the smallest styling changes can make a huge difference
- That having fun with the theme makes everything better

On to Week 3 next. We're building momentum, one styled tag at a time!
